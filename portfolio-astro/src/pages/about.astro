                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">I'm a self-taught software engineer transitioning from employment to consulting. My path to platform engineering began as a master electrician—a background that taught me to think systematically about complex infrastructure and the critical importance of reliability under pressure.</p>
                
                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">As a lifelong learner, I bring a rare combination of broad domain knowledge, keen attention to detail, and pattern recognition that spans both technical and organizational systems. This perspective allows me to see connections and opportunities that others often miss.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 px-8 text-slate-600 text-left">What Makes My Approach Different</h3>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">Most technical consultants focus on either deep implementation or high-level strategy. I work across the entire problem-solving lifecycle—from identifying systemic issues to designing solutions to building sustainable platforms.</p>
                
                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">My background as a master electrician taught me that failures are rarely about individual components—they're about systems thinking and understanding how problems cascade through complex networks. This perspective helps me build solutions that work within real organizational constraints, not theoretical conditions.</p>

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-slate-700">Consulting Philosophy</h4>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Organizations often struggle to articulate their technical needs because problems span multiple domains. My role is to bridge that gap—translating complex challenges into actionable solutions while working within your existing processes and decision-making culture.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 px-8 text-slate-600 text-left">Why This Matters to Your Organization</h3>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">Whether it's technology constraining business growth, systems that don't integrate across departments, or processes consuming too many engineering resources—I focus on sustainable solutions that prevent similar issues from recurring.</p>
                
                <p class="text-lg px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">My analytical approach and collaborative leadership style create unique value for organizations dealing with technical challenges that require both deep systems expertise and organizational understanding.</p>
