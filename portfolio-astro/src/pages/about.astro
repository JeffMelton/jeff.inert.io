                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">I'm a 49-year-old autodidactic software engineer transitioning from employment to consulting. My path to platform engineering began as a master electrician—a background that taught me to think systematically about complex infrastructure and the critical importance of reliability under pressure.</p>
                
                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">With 12+ years in technology and a neurodivergent cognitive profile (AuDHD), I bring an unusual combination of broad domain knowledge, extreme attention to detail, and pattern recognition that spans both technical and organizational systems. This cognitive style allows me to see connections and dysfunction that others often miss.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 px-8 text-slate-600 text-left">What Makes My Approach Different</h3>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">Most technical consultants focus on either deep technical implementation or high-level strategy. I work across the entire problem-solving lifecycle—from identifying systemic issues that span multiple domains, to designing comprehensive solutions that address root causes, to building and implementing the platforms that make those solutions sustainable.</p>
                
                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">My background as a master electrician taught me that infrastructure failures are rarely about individual components—they're about systems thinking, reliability engineering, and understanding how failure cascades through complex networks. This perspective, combined with extensive enterprise experience, allows me to diagnose organizational dysfunction and build technical solutions that route around institutional limitations.</p>
                
                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">Having led a 3-year organizational transformation after a major strategic technology failure, I understand both the technical complexity and the human dynamics involved in enterprise change. I specialize in finding broken or neglected systems and building solutions that work within actual organizational constraints, not theoretical ideal conditions.</p>

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4 text-slate-700">Consulting Philosophy</h4>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Organizations experiencing complex technical pain often can't articulate what they need because the problems span multiple domains and require both technical depth and business context understanding. My role is to bridge that gap—translating systemic dysfunction into actionable technical solutions while respecting enterprise decision-making processes and cultural realities.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 px-8 text-slate-600 text-left">Why This Matters to Your Organization</h3>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6 px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">Every organization is different, but the patterns of technical debt and systemic dysfunction are remarkably consistent. Whether it's infrastructure constraining business growth, systems that don't integrate properly across departments, or operational processes that waste engineering resources—I don't just identify what's broken; I understand why it matters to the business and build sustainable platforms that prevent similar problems from recurring.</p>
                
                <p class="text-lg px-12 text-left leading-relaxed">My neurodivergent cognitive profile provides advantages in pattern recognition, systematic analysis, and attention to detail that benefit complex enterprise environments. Combined with strong collaborative leadership and cross-team communication skills, this creates unique value for organizations dealing with technical challenges that require both deep systems expertise and organizational navigation.</p>
