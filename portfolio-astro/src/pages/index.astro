            <p>I work across the entire problem-solving lifecycle‚Äîfrom identifying systemic issues that span multiple domains, to designing comprehensive solutions that address root causes, to building and implementing the technical platforms that make those solutions sustainable.</p>

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>I specialize in diagnosing and solving technical problems that require both deep systems expertise and business context understanding. My work typically involves complex, multi-domain challenges where technical solutions must align with organizational realities and business objectives.</p>
            
            <p>Whether it's infrastructure that's constraining business growth, systems that don't integrate properly across departments, or operational processes that waste engineering resources‚ÄîI work from problem identification through solution design to technical implementation. I don't just identify what's broken; I understand why it matters to the business and build sustainable platforms that prevent similar problems from recurring.</p>

            <p>My approach combines technical depth with organizational insight, ensuring that solutions are not only technically sound but operationally viable and strategically aligned with business needs.</p>

            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>Every organization is different, but the patterns of technical debt and systemic dysfunction are remarkably consistent. I start by understanding not just what's broken, but why it broke ‚Äì what organizational or technical constraints led to the current state.</p>
            
            <p>Then I design solutions that work within your actual constraints, not theoretical ideal conditions. This often means building tools and processes that route around organizational limitations while gradually addressing root causes.</p>
            
            <p>The goal isn't just to solve the immediate problem, but to leave you with better systems, clearer processes, and the tools to prevent similar issues in the future.</p>
